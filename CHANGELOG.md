# CHANGELOG.md

## 1.0.3 (2022-04-04)

Features:
  - automatically ignores `.docx` files that start with `~` - these are temporary files that only exist when you have the Word document open
  - default behaviour now saves image files into subfolders specific for each document - eg. a document with the filename `mydoc.docx` will save images into `/images/mydoc/`
